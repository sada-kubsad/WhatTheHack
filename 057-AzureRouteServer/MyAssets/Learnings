I added a VM Onprem so that I can look at the effective routes associated with the NIC. 

Problem: 
  From the newly added on-prem VM aka datacenter VM (IP 172.16.1.68) in the diagram in  attached PDF,I could not ping to the Hub VM. 
  I can however ping from on-prem VM aka datacenter VM to the HUB VM and would see request and response ICMP messages processed in the Hub VM, but responses from Hub VM not getting back to on-prem VM aka datacenter VM. 
  I can however ping from the on-prem (aka datacenter) NVA to the hub VMs.

Cause: 
  On-prem VM ala datacenter VM has only 1 NIC configured with the tunnel. The newly created subnet (172.16.1.64/28) and the newly created VM are not connected to the on-prem VM aka dataccenter VM.

Solution:
  Add a static route on the on-prem Cisco NVA:
#ip route 172.16.1.64 255.255.255.0 172.16.1.1


Cannot do:
(config)#ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0  172.16.1.10
%Invalid next hop address (it's this router)
Nor:
datacenter-nva(config)#ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0  GigabitEthernet1


Add BGP Routes to Cisco NVA:
----------------------------
datacenter-nva#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
datacenter-nva(config)#router bgp 65501
datacenter-nva(config-router)#network 172.16.1.0 ma
datacenter-nva(config-router)#network 172.16.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0
datacenter-nva(config-router)#end
datacenter-nva#clear ip bgp * sof
datacenter-nva#ping 172.16.1.68
